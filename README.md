# Hey, I'm Taha.

I'm an AI engineer who builds products, not just features.

By day, I work on AI observability at an enterprise AI company. By night, I build things people actually use. I've shipped a consumer AI product to 100+ users, published research at IEEE, and I think most AI products fail not because the model is bad — but because nobody watches what happens after deployment.

This repo is my corner of the internet. The place where my work, my thinking, and my projects live.

It has six sections — Hero, About, Projects, Case Studies, Writing, and Contact — stitched into a single scrolling page, with dedicated detail pages for each case study.

### Built with

Next.js 15 (App Router) / TypeScript / Tailwind CSS v4 / Framer Motion / Vercel
